<div id="sylintegrity" class="container sec">
<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level2">
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic integrity is essential to the pursuit of learning and
scholarship in a university, and to ensuring that a degree from the
University of Toronto Mississauga is a strong signal of each student’s
individual academic achievement. As a result, UTM treats cases of
cheating and plagiarism very seriously. The University of Toronto’s <a
href="https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/code-behaviour-academic-matters-july-1-2019">Code
of Behaviour on Academic Matters</a> outlines behaviours that constitute
academic dishonesty and the process for addressing academic offences.
Potential offences include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>In papers and assignments:
<ul>
<li>Using someone else’s ideas or words without appropriate
acknowledgement.</li>
<li>Submitting your own work in more than one course, or more than once
in the same course, without the permission of the instructor.</li>
<li>Making up sources or facts.</li>
<li>Obtaining or providing unauthorized assistance on any
assignment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On tests and exams:
<ul>
<li>Using or possessing unauthorized aids.</li>
<li>Looking at someone else’s answers during an exam or test.</li>
<li>Misrepresenting your identity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In academic work:
<ul>
<li>Falsifying institutional documents or grades.</li>
<li>Falsifying or altering any documentation required, including (but
not limited to) doctor’s notes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that the department uses software that compares programs
for evidence of similar code. Below are some tips to help you avoid
committing an academic offence, like plagiarism.</p>
<ul>
<li>Never look at another student’s lab/assignment solution(s). Never
show another student your lab/assignment solution. This applies to all
drafts of a solution and to incomplete and even incorrect
solutions.</li>
<li>Keep discussions with other students focused on concepts and
examples. Never discuss labs/assignments before the due date with anyone
but your Instructors and your TAs. Do not discuss your solution publicly
on the discussion board or publicly in the lab rooms/office hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be investigated
following procedures outlined in the Code of Behaviour on Academic
Matters. If you have questions or concerns about what constitutes
appropriate academic behaviour or appropriate research and citation
methods, you are expected to seek out additional information on academic
integrity from your instructor or from other <a
href="https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/academic-integrity/students">institutional
resources</a>.</p>
<p>Honesty and fairness are fundamental to the University of Toronto’s
mission. Plagiarism is a form of academic fraud and is treated very
seriously. The work that you submit must be your own and cannot contain
anyone else’s work or ideas without proper attribution. You are expected
to read the handout <a
href="https://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/using-sources/how-not-to-plagiarize/">How
Not to Plagiarize</a> and be familiar with the <a
href="https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/code-behaviour-academic-matters-july-1-2019">Code
of Behaviour on Academic Matters</a>, linked from the UTM calendar under
the link Codes and Policies.</p>
<p>All of the work you submit must be done by you, and your work must
not be submitted by someone else. Plagiarism is academic fraud and is
taken very seriously. The department uses software that compares
programs for evidence of similar code. Please read the Rules and
Regulations from the U of T Calendar (especially the Code of Behaviour
on Academic Matters).</p>
<p>Students may use artificial intelligence tools, including generative
AI, in this course as learning aids or to help produce assignments. (Dan
wrote a book about programming with generative AI. He’s serious about
this: if GenAI helps you, please use it.) However, students are
ultimately accountable for the work they submit. Any content produced by
an artificial intelligence tool must be cited appropriately. Many
organizations that publish standard citation formats are now providing
information on citing generative AI (e.g., MLA: <a
href="https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/"
class="uri">https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/</a>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the tests and exams in this course will not allow the
use of generative AI tools as aids, so you must be prepared to solve
exercises, including writing significant code, without assistance. As a
result, it is highly recommended that generative AI be used as a
learning aid and that any material that is built on the output of
generative AI tools be reviewed so that you are confident that it
reflects what you understand and can produce on your own.</p>
<p>Please do not cheat. It is unpleasant for everyone involved,
including us. Here are some general guidelines to help you avoid
plagiarism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never look at another student’s assignment solution. Never show
another student your assignment solution. This applies to all solution
drafts and incomplete and even incorrect solutions.</li>
<li>Keep discussions with other students focused on concepts and
examples. Never discuss assignments before the due date with anyone but
your Instructor and your Teaching Assistants.</li>
<li>During the Midterm/Final Examination, once you enter the room, only
communicate with the Invigilator(s), Instructor, and/or Teaching
Assistant(s).</li>
<li>Ensure that notes, electronics, and/or communication devices (e.g.,
cell phone, tablet, computer, etc.) are not on your physical person in
the Midterm/Final Examination room.</li>
</ul>
<p>All submitted work is subject to verification with plagiarism
detection tools.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="sylplagiarism" class="container sec">
<div id="plagiarism-detection" class="section level2">
<h2>Plagiarism Detection</h2>
<p>Normally, students will be required to submit their course essays to
the University’s plagiarism detection tool for a review of textual
similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students
will allow their essays to be included as source documents in the tool’s
reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of
detecting plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of
this tool are described on the <a
href="https://teaching.utoronto.ca/resources/plagiarism-detection/">Centre
for Teaching Support &amp; Innovation</a> web site.</p>
<p>Students may wish to opt out of using the plagiarism detection tool.
In order to opt out, contact your instructor by email no later than two
(2) weeks after the start of classes. If you have opted out, then
specific information on an alternative method to submit your assignment
can be found below.</p>

<div id="sylconsent" class="container sec">
<div id="informed-consent-email-lists" class="section level2">
<h2>Informed Consent – Email Lists</h2>
<p>As a student enrolled in this course, you understand that you are
providing your implicit consent to be included in an email list for the
department to send you non-essential information from time to time. If
you do not wish to be included in such an email list, please request to
be removed by contacting one of the Academic Advisors &amp;
Undergraduate Program Administrators. Their information can be found on
the MCS Website Contact Us <a

<div id="sylmissterm" class="container sec">
<div id="missed-term-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Missed Term Work</h2>
<p>In general, if work is missed due to an emergency situation, then the
weight of the work will be placed on other similar components in the
course. For example, a missed term test would add to the weight of the
final exam, and a missed assignment would add to the weight of a later
assignment. Exact accommodation will be discussed between the student
and the instructor, who must be informed within 72 hours of the due
date.</p>
</div>

<div id="sylmissfin" class="container sec">
<div id="missed-final-exam" class="section level2">
<h2>Missed Final Exam</h2>
<p>Students who cannot complete their final examination due to illness
or other serious causes must file an <a
href="https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/registrar/petitions">online
petition</a> <strong>within 72 hours</strong> <strong>of the missed
examination</strong>. Late petitions will <strong>NOT</strong> be
considered. Upon approval of a deferred exam request, a nonrefundable
fee is required for each examination approved. See the <a

<div id="sylremark" class="container sec">
<div id="remark-requests" class="section level2">
<h2>Remark Requests</h2>
<p>Remark requests for Programming Assignments, Problem Sets, Wireshark
Labs, and Midterm are due within 1 week of receiving the graded work and
must be submitted by posting a private note on Piazza.</p>
<ul>
<li>We ask that you carefully review your assignments, reflect, and
write a short explanation justifying the reasons for a regrading
request.</li>
<li>If a grade is contested and we realize that the marker made a
mistake in the student’s favour, the mark for that assignment may be
lowered when the mistake is found. This would otherwise create a
situation which is unfair to other students.</li>
<li>Please include your full name and UTORid in the body of the private
note.</li>

<h2>Special Consideration</h2>
<p>Please contact us immediately if you cannot complete coursework or
miss a test due to a major illness or other circumstances outside your
control. Special consideration will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis
and is not given automatically. We may be unable to grant you exactly
the special consideration you seek, so please ensure we have time to
discuss your situation.</p>
<p>In order to receive special consideration, you must fill out a
Request for Special Consideration Form. Submit the form in PDF format as
soon as possible, together with any supporting documentation, to the
course instructor’s email address.</p>
<p>You can contact us (by email using the course instructor’s email
address) even before you have your documentation ready to submit; we
won’t be able to tell you at that point what accommodation you may
receive, but we can answer other questions and offer advice. It is
always easier to resolve situations earlier rather than later. If you
face a particularly disruptive situation that is likely to impact more
than one course, please contact your College Registrar. They are best
equipped to provide you with general advice and support that goes beyond
a single course.</p>

<div id="discussion-board" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion Board</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>For all questions of general interest (whose answers are likely
to be useful to other students, e.g., about the course material, problem
sets, programming assignments, Wireshark labs, general questions about
course logistics and administration), where you can ask the question
while respecting the academic integrity of the course (without revealing
any idea or part of a solution to a course assessment), please start a
new topic directly on the Piazza discussion forum, so that everyone can
benefit from reading your questions and the associated answers. We will
monitor the forum regularly, but feel free to answer questions from
other students, too! Helping someone else learn is one of the most
effective ways to master a subject.</p></li>
<li><p>For personal questions (making appointments, remarking requests,
extensions, missing class, etc.), please email the course instructor
directly from your University of Toronto email address. Please include
“CSC358” in the subject line and your full name and UTORid in the body
of the email. Otherwise, your message might be marked as spam! We aim to
respond to all email and forum postings by the end of the next business
day (not counting weekends and holidays). However, it may take longer,
especially near due dates. If you do not hear back after four days,
please do not hesitate to send a follow-up email or come in person
during office hours.</p></li>
